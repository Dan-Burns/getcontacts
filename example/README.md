# Examples of how to run the `contact_network.py` script

## Dynamic contacts for the parvalbumin NMR bundle (PDB-id 5XND)

The file `5xnd_trajectory.pdb` was generated by downloading 5xnd from the PDB and running `mdconvert --output 5xnd_trajectory.dcd 5xnd.pdb`. The corresponding topology file contains the first frame of the NMR bundle. To compute the file `5xnd_all-contacts.tsv` with details of all interaction types in the bundle, run the command
```bash
python3 ../contact_networks.py --topology 5xnd_topology.pdb --trajectory 5xnd_trajectory.dcd --all-interactions --output 5xnd_all-contacts.tsv
```


## Static contacts in Crambin (PDB-id 1CRN)

The `contact_network.py` script can be used to generate contacts of a single-model PDB file as well, but often files downloaded from PDB directly need to have hydrogens added. This can be done in pymol after which the interactions can be computed
```bash
pymol -c -d 'fetch 1crn, async=0; h_add; save 1crn_h.pdb'  # Prepare 1CRN
python3 ../contact_networks.py --topology 1crn_h.pdb --all-interactions --output 1crn_h_all-contacts.tsv
```
